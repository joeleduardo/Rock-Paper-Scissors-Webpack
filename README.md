# Rock Paper Scissors Challenge (Webpack 4 Version)

This version was made it using *webpack (4.18.0)* and some plugins/libraries to load, extract, minify and package the application *without use a framework* to write easily JS. As a part of these plugins, *autoprefixer* give us capabilities to cover many browsers and understand CSS3 (*IE 11, Edge, Firefox, Chrome, Safari, iOS Safari, Opera, Chrome for Android, Samsung*) so you can display it in your mobile and have fun.

Because isn't a complex exercise was written with a basic and understandable architecture of Javascript but using some advangates of *ES6 (arrow functions, scope variables declarations, literals, etc.)* and use *babel js as transpiler*, so you can take a look and see how easy is read it and modify.

Download the project first, then install dependencies by `npm`

```
npm install
```

And run it

```
npm start
```

If your want to get a PRODUCTION version just run

```
npm run build
```

Then take a look inside `/dist` folder
